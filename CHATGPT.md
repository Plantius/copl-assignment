- $\textbold{Can you review my code: \textit{main.cc}}$

Your code appears to be a C++ program for parsing and tokenizing files based on user input. Overall, it seems well-structured and logically organized. I have a few suggestions and comments to improve the code:

1. **Comments and Documentation**:
   It's great that you've included comments at the beginning of your code to explain its purpose and authorship. However, it's also important to provide inline comments explaining complex logic or non-obvious parts of the code. Inline comments help others understand your code more easily. For instance, explaining what `validInput(filepath)` and `parse.getError()` do would be helpful.

2. **Include Guards**:
   Ensure that you have proper include guards in your header files (`standard.h`, `parser.h`, `token.h`) to prevent multiple inclusions.

3. **Use of Namespaces**:
   Be cautious when using `using namespace std;`. It's generally better to avoid using it at the global scope, as it can lead to naming conflicts. It's fine to use it within a limited scope like a function if needed.

4. **Error Handling**:
   You have error handling for invalid input files and parsing errors (`if (validInput(filepath))` and `if (parse.getError())`). It would be helpful to provide more specific error messages to the user in these cases, so they understand what went wrong.

5. **Timing Code**:
   The code to measure the time taken for tokenization is a good addition for profiling. Just make sure to inform the user of what these timings represent. You might also want to handle the case where the user selects option 0 multiple times and the timings accumulate.

6. **Input Handling**:
   When taking user input, be aware that using `cin >> option` can lead to issues if the user enters non-integer input. Consider using `cin.ignore()` or `cin.clear()` along with `cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n')` to handle input errors gracefully.

7. **String Input**:
   When reading the file path and displaying it, consider handling spaces and any potential leading/trailing whitespace more gracefully.

8. **Function Modularity**:
   Consider breaking down some parts of your `main` function into smaller, more modular functions. For example, the file reading and tokenization logic can be placed in separate functions for clarity.

9. **Exit Codes**:
   It's common to use exit codes like `0` for success and non-zero values for different types of errors. You might consider using a non-zero exit code when there's an error condition, making it easier for other programs/scripts to detect and handle errors.

10. **Error Handling for Invalid Menu Options**:
    You might want to handle cases where the user enters an invalid menu option (neither 0 nor 1). Currently, your code prints an "Invalid input, try again." message, but it continues the loop. You could prompt the user for input again in this case.

11. **Resource Management**:
    You're using `std::string`, which manages its own memory, but if your actual code involves more complex resource management (e.g., dynamic memory allocation), remember to handle resource cleanup and deallocation properly.

By following these suggestions, you can improve the readability, maintainability, and robustness of your code.
